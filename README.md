# predicting-bike-sharing-patterns
First project in Udacity's Deep Learning Nano Degree. It is an exercise in implementing a neural network 'from scratch,' without relying on PyTorch or TensorFlow. 

---

This project involves: 

Implementing a:
* sigmoid function
* forward pass 
* a single hidden layer
* a backward pass that correctly updates weights

Correctly choosing: 
* learning rate 
*  number of output nodes

Attaining:
* training loss below 0.09
* validation loss below 0.18
